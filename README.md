<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

### Project Idea
 An online platform that collects information about libraries across the UC Berkeley campus and recommends the user a selection of choices based on user preference input. Accessible information about libraries which the “filter by” feature will be based upon includes a live crowd meter, user reviews, open hours, and more. 

### Motivation: 
For any given day, students generally struggle to choose a library to study in that is not crowded, open, or relatively close to where they are currently standing. The pursuit of our project idea will serve as a handy tool to help students find the most optimal library on campus based on their personal preferences, in addition to facilitating study group formations.



### Built With:
React.js, Axios, Chakra UI, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js
